## Develop React Application Locally

1. Change To React Application Directory:

```zsh
cd ui
```

2. Cleanup Code:

```zsh
yarn prettier --write .
```

3. Start React Application:

```zsh
yarn dev
```

4. Access React Application:

Access @ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Develop Python Application Locally

1. Change To Python Application Directory:

```zsh
cd py
```

2. Create Requirements File:

```zsh
pip freeze > requirements.txt || pip install pipreqs
```

3. Install Requirements File:

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Test Requirements File:

```zsh
python -m pip check
```

5. Start Python Application:
